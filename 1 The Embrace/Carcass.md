# Info

Carcass is a neutral city within Dain, build within the slowly regenerating corpse of an prehistorical [[Tarrasque]]. Its main export include different [[Tarrasque]] materials, with the magic negating stomach acid considered to be especially valuable.

## Defences



## Shops

- [[The Groaning Breach]] — Tavern and travel location
- [[The Gnome’s Mechanism]] — Slightly fancy tavern
- [[The Kobold’s Hoard]] — Cheap tavern that’s often full

## Housing

The houses are carved or bound to the bones of the [[Tarrasque]]. The skull houses the townhall.
