# Poten — God of Chance

```toc
```

## Depiction

![[Poten_TradingCard.jpg]]

Poten is dressed in luxury. A green cloak made of the finest silk with red edges and golden, tribal embroidery often adorns his skin. Skin as dark as the night sky. He has long, luscious white hair that falls into curls. Some of the curls clump together giving a horn-like appearance. His eyes have no pupils, for luck is blind. His iris is a glowing red. His arms have a golden pattern much like a spider's web. The rest of his body looks like a regular [[Theran|Elf]].

## Personality

Poten is a gambler. Not much of a surprise when you consider him being the God of Chance. He likes to live in luxury and doesn't mind showing off from time to time. If he wants something, he damn well gets it. If he can't get it, that's when the game starts. He is a true game master. He can't say no when the stakes are high enough. But whenever you make a deal with Poten, remember that the odds are never in your favor.

If Poten wants something from you, you become his ‘drinking buddy’. Often he picks you for a suspected underlying desire for chaos. He will put you on quests meant to disrupt systems. To create vacuums of power where random chance will control the future of possibly entire continents. This does not mean, however, that he doesn’t have personal vendettas. Poten is still a god. If you’re unlucky enough to become his warlock, you will be manipulated so you can become one more pawn in his chess game against his sister.^[see:[[Euna]]]

## Worship

Like all gods, there are moments in one’s life where they invoke Poten’s name. In poten’s case, that would be when winning or losing a game. Being of the high pantheon, he also has a temple dedicated to him. The [[Cult of Poten]] is most often found in cities like [[Kuulanaka’uhale One]]; cities with a large gaming scene. Their priests wear silken robes of green with an inner red lining. Depending on the internal ranking, their robes are embroided with golden prayers and symbols

## Relation to the Other Gods

### [[Euna]]

Poten ***hates*** his sister. Where Poten revels in manipulation, Euna works tirelessly to free those from Poten’s will. They play a chess game, but one where Poten keeps creating more and more pawns while Euna actually knows proper strategy. If the deities of [[The Embrace]] were not barred from killing each other outright, Poten would've long been an only child.

### [[Murmur]]

Poten does anything in his power to make sure he holds all the cards. This caused a strong friendship to form between him and the God of Whispers, the biggest gossip in the pantheon. Poten requires information, Murmur puts their spies to work. Murmur needs someone to tell the latest news to, Poten is there with one of his famous roulette wine.
