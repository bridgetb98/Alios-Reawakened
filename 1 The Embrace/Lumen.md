# Lumen

## [[Chrylis]]' Notes

Past the 5 standard seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, [[The Embrace]] experiences a $5^{th}$ one. It consists of 3, 5 day weeks of night where the barrier between the realms of [[Thera - Primordial Matter|Thera]] and [[Void - Primordial Energy|Void]] cease to exist. Demons start pouring out from the [[Void Realm]], and spirits become physical creatures. I've decided to dub this season "Lumen".^[And who said scholaOs don't have a sense of humor!]
