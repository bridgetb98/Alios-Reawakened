# Dain

```toc
```

The continent ‘abandoned by the Gods’. The continent is used by [[The Powers that Be]] as an imprisonment colony, due to the strange phenomenon surrounding it making it near impossible to escape.

Wild magic is rampant within Dain. This is made physical through [[Wild Magic Geyser]]s.

## Climate

The effects of wild magic has caused the climate of Dain to be completely out of whack. Scalding deserts can be found right next to massive glaciers. The landscape tends to shift between climates with yet unknown regularity.

## Groups within Dain

- [[Circle of the Everlight]]
- [[The Grand Thievery]]
- [[Geyser Guys]]
- [[Salamanders]]
- [[Otherworldly Goods]]
