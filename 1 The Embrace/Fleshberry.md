*Average Weight: 616.6 gram*

The Fragaria Corporis is the swollen fruit of the Genus Fragaria. Due to the amount of fluids inside of the fruit in combination with the pulp, it has a similar texture to that of animal flesh. The fruit pulses in a rhythm that's slightly slower than the average human's heartbeat. All these factors caused it to be more commonly referred to as the "fleshberry" in conversation. When consumed, the fruit has been reported as to having a very faint sweet taste. This, together with the ease of access, has made it a popular ingredient in most dishes.

An infected Fragaria Corporis can spread its seeds about 35 metres on average. The highest recorded distance was 42 metres. This force made it a popular improvisational bomb when the Fragaria Ananassa was a lot more common.

Fragaria Corporis is known to reproduce in 3 distinct ways:
1. The most common way for Fragaria Corporis to reproduce is for one of its cuttings to grow a certain distance away from the mother plant. At that point it can root itself into the ground allowing for the growth of a new Genus Fragaria to grow.
2. Another common way for the reproduction of the Fragaria Corporis is by planting the seeds nestled inside of the fruit. Similarly, to planting one of the cuttings, this will result in the growth of another Genus Fragaria plant.
3. The original way of reproduction, which is currently a lot rarer due to the lack of Fragaria Ananassa in the Lost Rift, is the infection of its parent species. When a Fragaria Ananassa is infected with the seeds of the Fragaria Corporis, the fruit will rapidly swell, sucking up most of the moisture in the area until it resembles the Fragaria Corporis. After a period of 2 hours, the fruit explodes with a violent force strong enough to launch a small rat about 3 metres upwards, killing the host plant in the process. The spreaded seeds grow into a new Genus Fragaria plant with a regular Fragaria Corporis as its fruit.

## The Fleshberry Plague

The first case of the Fragaria Corporis was found on a small island in Bifjorland in 395 OPB. This island hosted the wizard's tower of the gnome Daphissa Xyrotina Vobi Hesmila Rasfiz. Once this fruit was brought to the mainland, the high infection rate of the fruit became known. This caused the event widely known as "the fleshberry plague". Within a period of 112 years, the Fragaria Corporis had spread across the entire Embrace. The Council of the Powers That Be made an official declaration that the Fragaria Ananassa has gone extinct.

The explosive force of the Fragaria Corporis has led to numerous deaths in the early years of the fleshberry expansion throughout the known world. Most notably lord Gerald Wintelsbar. During the siege of Holzbeck in 401 OPB, 5 infected Fragaria Corporis were thrown over the holding's walls. Within a 1-day period, all Fragaria Ananassa in Holzbeck, back then its most valuable trade resource, became infected. This sadly enough included those Lord Wintelsbar was eating during his afternoon tea.

## Fleshberry Myths

It is said that eating an infected Fragaria Corporis can lead to a mutation. This mutation causes the victim to turn into a Genus Fragaria plant obsessed with the spread of the Fragaria Corporis. Since this has yet to be observed, it is considered nothing more than a myth.
