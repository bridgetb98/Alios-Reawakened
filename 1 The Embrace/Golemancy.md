Golemancy is the magic linked to [[Knowledge]] and [[Memory]].

# Magic

## Abilities

Golemancy binds a [[Spirits|spirit]] to a mechanical or materialistic body. The closer the body is to an [[Elves|elven]] one, the longer the spirit remains bound.

When creating a [[Golem]], it is given a single command. It tries to fulfil this command to the best of its abilities. Once the command has been fulfilled, the [[Golem]] goes into an inactive state where the creation [[Glyphs|Glyph]] is exposed.

## Limits

A [[Golem]] is restricted to simple commands of up to five ($5$) words. A [[Golem]] has a basic understanding of life preservation. It will stop following commands if its own ‘life’ is in danger.

Though the [[Golem]] has visible sentience, much like basic [[Spirits]] it does not display sapience. It is currently unknown how a [[Golem]] transforms into a [[Golite]] or a [[Warforged]].

A single person can passively control up to ten ($10$) [[Golem]]s, and can control fifteen ($15$) through meditation. There are historical records about people that have controlled a large amount of [[Golem]]s, with sizes rivaling armies, but it is currently unknown how this can be achieved.

## Cost

To create a [[Golem]],  you need a creation [[Glyphs|Glyph]]. These discs contain the pattern to call, bind, and control the [[Spirits|spirit]].

[[Binding]] requires a bit of [[Attention]]. Thus, no external energy source can be used to power the [[Glyphs|Glyph]].

## Experience

Once a [[Golem]] has been created, the [[Golemancer]] will have a permanent feeling of a separate consciousness trying to occupy their brain. Handling more [[Golem]]s than the [[Golemancer]] can handle, causes them to go brain dead. The created [[Golem]]s, however, will still follow their order until completion.
