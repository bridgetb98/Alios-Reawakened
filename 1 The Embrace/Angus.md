#### Birth of Terror

>[!quote|author] [[Roel Vergeer]]
>So what I wanted to do is Angus once was a jolly god a happy god, until he lost his wife. The terrible pain and grief made him mourn, he mourned so much his skin started to decay, where once he was jolly he now turned sour. But out of his tears a small sapling bloomed, not only did he sapling bloom but it sprouted out seeds everywhere around it and in the most dire of moments All Angus hope and emotions an the life force of the plant made it grew into a baby girl which today we know as holo.
>
But where holo got some of her dads emotions she didn’t get his bitterness, it put a wedge between them, because of angus eternal grief. Looking for something new to fill the void Holo planted the seeds of life that would florish to be the humans, but these early humans where flawed for they saw only light and good. They died being unable to see the risks they where taking. It saddend Holo deeply.

>Angus not wanting his daughter to grieve like him decided that he would fix this. So holo with his decaying body presented himself to the people, waved his broken arms, smirked his hellish smirk and weeped with the sound of demonic weeps. On that day it’s said all over the human world a new emotion was born. The emotion of anguish
