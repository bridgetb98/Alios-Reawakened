> Tooth for tooth, eye for eye, but always leave a crumb for the next guy.

> Hide the socks, tickle the chickens, and never admit you did it.

> We guard the shadows, shield the weak, and watch over the silent.

> Smash it all, break it down, chaos is our playground.

> Throw it up, stir it wild, dance in the hurricane's eye.

> Invisible whispers, quiet as night, we'll snatch your dreams and slip from sight.

> Laughter's our weapon, tricks our trade, mischief is the game we've played.

> Bark in our veins, leaves in our hearts, we are the guardians of the forest's arts.

> Shiny, gleamy, hoard it all, our precious stash, behind the hidden wall.

> Brew, bubble, concoct, and stir, secrets of elixirs, we shall confer.

> Underground dwellers, dark and deep, our secrets in the earth we keep.

> Dance in flames, wield the fire, burning brighter, never tire.

> Frozen hearts, icy grip, in the tundra's chill, we'll never slip.

> Wings and feathers, high we soar, the sky's secrets, we'll explore.

> Salty waves, endless blue, the ocean's depths, we'll venture through.

> Gears and cogs, ticking time, our machines are sublime.

> Cogitate, innovate, create the contraptions of fate.

> Wander far, roam the land, the world's vastness, we'll understand.

> Amidst the vines, through the trees, in the heart of the jungle, we find our ease.

> Starry skies, cosmic flight, in the heavens, we seek our light.

> Carve, sculpt, and craft with care, beauty from stone, our talent we share.

> In the realm of dreams, we dance and weave, shaping fantasies that none can perceive.

> Crystals and chants, ancient lore, we harness magic's power, forever more.

> Gears and steam, metal's embrace, in our brass kingdoms, we find our place.

> In the realm of shadows, we silently roam, our secrets hidden, in darkness we're at home.

> March to the drum, weapons at the ready, we're the fierce battalion, strong and steady. In the heat of battle, we stand as one, [[Goblins|goblin]] warriors, our foes on the run. Loyalty to the clan, the mission our guide, in the chaos of war, we'll never divide. Shields up, spears sharp, for victory we strive, in the realm of conflict, we'll always survive.
