## What Worked
I was really happy how the players interacted with eachother. I also feel like repeating the names of the NPCs helps a lot with getting them in everyone’s memories. The potions are great, and I think that using wild magic surges as a compromise for over drinking is a good idea. The veil stuff was good.
## What Didn't Work
Could describe the fabric analogy with the Veil a bit better. Maybe when repeating names, just use the first name instead of the full one. Think that’ll work a bit better.
## Players' Reaction
We lost [[Monika McSpace|Monika]] ;(
Good vibes in a tales of BaSingCe session
