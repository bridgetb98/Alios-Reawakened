## What Worked
The sudden chaos was fantastic. The interaction with fluffy was alright, but I truly think that final half really made the session great.

## What Didn't Work
I think the beginning scouting could’ve been better and the descriptions of the [[Goblins|Goblin]] camp should’ve been more alive. Also I really wanted to give the reigns of Fluffy to [[Roel Vergeer]], but that didn’t work out.

## Players' Reaction
They loved this session. Which is fantastic for me to hear. They look incredibly forward to the next time we’ll play.
