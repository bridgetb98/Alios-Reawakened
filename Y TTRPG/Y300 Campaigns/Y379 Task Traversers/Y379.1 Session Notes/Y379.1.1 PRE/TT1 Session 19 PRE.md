## Important NPCs

[[Pengesække]] — A human capitalist from the [[2800.6 Hoomana Guild|Ho'omana Guild]]. He controls the main bank in this small desert town, but, as he likes to point out, he’s not a member of the community.

[[Roland Vabenforer]] — An elven woman who tends to be somewhat grumpy. Doesn’t take to kindly to strangers. Tries to keep the town stable by sharing as much of her water as she can afford.

[[Leder Mekanisk]] — A [[Golite]] sherif with a deep sense of honour. Doesn’t need to drink, so the situation hasn’t affected them personally. However, they are getting more and more worried about how everyone is reacting. Romantic partner of [[Roland Vabenforer]]

[[Devil of Mutalation|Tomt Barn]] — A terrified child who, by cause of an impulse she couldn’t control, caused some form of mutilation to all in the small town.
