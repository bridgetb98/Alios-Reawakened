### [[Leder Mekanisk]]

A [[Golite]] sherif with a deep sense of honour. Doesn’t need to drink, so the situation hasn’t affected them personally. However, they are getting more and more worried about how everyone is reacting. Romantic partner of [[Roland Vabenforer]]

A terrified child who, by cause of an impulse she couldn’t control, caused some form of mutilation to all in the small town. She's also the devil of mutilation
