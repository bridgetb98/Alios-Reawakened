# Intro

Welcome you filthy convicts to [[Dain]]. The continent that’s been abandoned by the Gods. A prison colony filled with strange magic and ruthless people. Don’t try to escape. It’s impossible for you to leave.

Hello and welcome to the Magic Geysers campaign. This is a West-Marchers campaign, meaning that everyone can either play or GM, but more on that in the rules section. This zine is design to both explain how the gameplay loop is intended to work^[with plenty of flexibility.] and to help you orient yourself in the workings of this continent. This zine is a living document and will update as [[Dain]] gets expanded over the course of the campaign.

Welcome and good luck!
