## Plot Advancements

[[Brutus]] and [[Trigaldar]] have ‘escaped’ the temple. They need to figure out a way to fully get out of the [[Circle of the Everlight|Everlight]] territory. The plan, currently, is for them to find a stable gyser portal in the adjacent town and that way they can teleport to the [[Carcass]]. Along the way they can find the rest of the characters. AAAAA!

## Side-Plots or Twists



# Important NPCs

- [[Olad]] — [[The Groaning Breach]]’s barkeep/owner | “This tavern is as clean as an Elven’s arse.”
