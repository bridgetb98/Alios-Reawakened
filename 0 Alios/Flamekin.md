title: # Flamekin
```

Flamekin is the name given to the species created by the aspect of [[Conservation]]. Theyâ€™re similar to [[Fire Elemental]]s, except for the fact that they have the ability to generate, store, and transfer energy in the form of heat.^[see: [[Flamecraft]]]

# Anatomy & Morphology

Flamekin have a gelatine body that glows in a multitude of colors, depending on race. The vulnerable body has an outer slate shell. It is a cultural practice to remove parts of this shell for aesthetic reasons.^[see: [[Flamekin Engraving]]] They have [[Elves|Elven]] body types, but are taller than the average [[Theran Bloodline]].

Dissection has provided the following information:
- The species is a silicate lifeform.
- Nutrients and neurons flow freely inside the gel-like substance of the body.
- Eyes are pressent, though are closer in substance to the gel that constructs the rest of their bodies.
- Flame glands are pressant on the head, armpits, and soles of the feet.
