# Anatomy & Morphology

*physical design of the species, number of limbs, muscular and skeletal structure etc.*

Elves are axolotl-like. More alien than us in appearance, yet still with aspects that we would categorize as 'mammal traits'. Their skin is smooth and slick. Their appendages seem underdeveloped with their hands possessing long, thin digits. They have 3 Gill stalks on either side of their head, though the gills themselves have long since disappeared due to an evolutionary lack of purpose. Despite any lack of facial hair on any spot on their bodies, they have developed long strands of hair on their scalp^[still unsure if this is for survival, or more sexual reasons]. The hairs have bright colours^[again, nor sure yet if this is for fey camouflage or for aesthetics. The brighter/more appealing the colour, the higher chance of attracting a mate]
