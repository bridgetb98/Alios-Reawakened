# Personification

Once worshipped as an ancient force of war and destruction, Ambition has since taken to the road as a creator. He draws the more welcoming vistas of the [[The Embrace|Embrace]], and builds clay dioramas of different battlefields. He's kind and calm. He wears a pack full of art supplies and has a massive sword strapped to his back. He has a short haircut and a full beard, both he paints in a multitude of different colours. He wears simple travel gear, adorned with a complex embroidery which becomes difficult to comprehend the longer you stare at it
