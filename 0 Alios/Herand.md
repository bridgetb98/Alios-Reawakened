Herand is a planet in the 5th quadrand of [[Alios]]. It is currently under the protection of [[Silver Wing Discoveries]].

# History

The [[Flamekin]]’s mastery of heat-based magi was the secret to the [[Stella Imperium]]’s hyper efficient engines. The liberation of Herand during the early stages of the [[Eclipse Wars]] was the first tide turn against the [[Stella Imperium|Stella]].

## Current Standing

The services of Herand’s [[Flamekin]] are desired across all of [[Alios]]. The generous export of thermal engineers allows for them to keep their independent status, though it is a strained one.

The southern part of Herand contains some of the largest engineering schools of the planet. Though Thermal engineers is the main focus, other types of engineering aren’t any less focused upon
