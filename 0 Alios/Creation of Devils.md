A devil is not born in a natural process. Instead, they're created through thought. When a fear is strong and far reaching, a devil will spawn as a physical manifestation of it. The stronger the fear, the stronger the devil. Despite being made of fear, they're don't need to have a malicious personality. In fact, most can be negotiated with.

There are 5 devils stronger than all. They were there when the first person felt dread in their mind. They will be there until the last person stops thinking
