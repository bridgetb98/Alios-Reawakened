## [[Chrylis]]' Notes

The primordial gods work in ways that can't be understand by us. I've tried my best to understand the way they communicate. This is as far as I've been able to get.

They have their own language that's filled with great power. It's a language with strict, logical grammar. Though, strangely enough, this is a logic even the primordials seem to be unable to escape. It makes me wonder who created this language, and if there's a being even greater than the primordials. Something beyond [[Alios]]

The ability to speak these words seem to require a strong mind; so not mine. They can remain stuck in someone's brain, however. Curiously enough, on the planet [[Rustir]] everyone seems to be born with one of these words. [[Whisper]]s, they call it. Most other people, however, seem to go mad uttering these strange words.
