## Chrylis’ Notes

Hello! As I’ve been writing my research in this here notebook, I’ve come to realize that I’ve failed to introduce myself. Not a big problem as long as I publish my own work, but future researchers need to know who to give proper credits to.

I’m Chrylis, a cosmologist from the forests of [[South Olpen]], on the planet known as [[The Embrace]], at the edge of [[Alios]].

I’ve been traveling the [[Starlanes]] since I was…

16? Possibly 17? I’ve come to the age where counting is no longer of interest. It was near the [[Titan]]’s downfall.

You see, I’m a [[Dragons|Dragon]]. Officially, I belong to the [[Order Party]]. I’ve long tried to avoid politics. It goes against my goals; survival of our species, and scholarly freedom. I belief the two are linked and might even lead [[The Embrace]] to join greater [[Alios]] and its many wonders.

I first left [[The Embrace]] as a last-ditch effort from my parents to protect me. Many [[Dragons]] survived yes, but not in [[Theocracy of Olpen|Olpen]], where the slaughter started. [[Taher]] opened the hunt with a scourged-world policy towards [[Devils]], [[Dragons]], and [[Giants]]. [[Devils]] regenerate, of course, as long as its fear is still alive. I can’t help but wonder if this worthless genocide was just the extended cries of a juvenile godling reliving the trauma of [[The Shadow Beast; The Devil of Separation|The Shadow Beast]].

Sorry, back to my travels of [[Alios]].

Leaving and entering [[The Embrace]] takes tremendous amounts of energy. It so often leaves those passing through [[The Veil]] in a coma, assuming they are native to the the planet. The big hurdle is the fact that [[Void - Primordial Energy|Void]] Themself protects [[The Veil]]. The tiny bit of [[Thera - Primordial Matter|Thera]] within me made me lucky enough that I only had to spend my first decade on the [[Starlanes]] asleep. Nowadays we know about the security flaw in [[Void - Primordial Energy|Void]]’s watch. If you pass [[The Veil]] through [[Realm of Void|Void’s Realm]], you can avoid Their gaze.
