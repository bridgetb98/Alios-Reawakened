title: # Starlanes
```

The starlanes are connections between habitable planetary systems within [[Alios]]. When a interspace vessel travels over the lanes, they do so in hyperspeed.

# Creation

The starlanes are a creation of [[Extyx - Primordial Infinity|Extyx]]. However, as with many things primordial, it is unknown as to why.

## Temporary Lanes

# Travel

To travel on the starlanes, one needs a vessel clad in [[Aberant]]. This metal seems to ‘reject’ the lanes, gliding off it.^[Some dispute the idea that it’s ‘gliding’, and claim it’s closer to ‘high frequency bouncing’.] The resulting effect is hyperspeed traveling.^[traveling at speeds greater than the speed of light.] most [[Imperium]] vessels come with a map of the lanes built into their PDA. Note that even with a vessel it’s still possible to travel the lanes, but at regular speeds. It is advised to avoid such a scenario, as it turns travel of just a few hours into millions of years.

## Off-Lane

Because the starlanes are basically an highway between colonized worlds,  it sometimes becomes necessary to travel off-lane. Situations where it’s common to travel off-lane include:

>[!column|no-t]
>>[!info|clean no-t]
>>- Resource gathering
>>- Battles
>>- Salvaging
>
>>[!info|clean no-t]
>>- Research
>>- Stealth

Note that ships without an [[Aberant]] chassis can travel off-lane. Fighter jets, for example, are rarely cladded in [[Aberant]] as combat on the lanes requires very specific conditions.

## Anomalous Connections

There are some connections that don’t fit the criteria ‘habitable planetary systems’. Because it is impossible to determine a primordial’s intent,^[And because the suggestion ‘Extyx just thought it was funny’ has been rejected.] these are considered ‘anomalous’. Anomalous lanes include:

- **AC-0000**: A lane connected to the central black hole of [[Alios]].^[see:[[Alios - Primordial Creation|0980.1]]]
- **AC-0001**: A lane connected to a strange black [[The Veil|veil]]. Speculation is that this might be a habitable system, but the few who have breached [[The Veil]] and survived^[including [[Chrylis]], I might add.] have refused to comment.
- **AC-0100**: Some lanes surrounding systems with dead planets labeled ‘[[Aspect Lost]]’. Usually a system losing their aspects causes the lane to be broken.^[I wonder if this means the lanes are somehow bound to the [[Aspects]]. More research needed here.]
- **AC-0101**: Lanes leading into the middle of deep space.
