```

The starlanes are connections between habitable planetary systems within [[Alios]]. When a interspace vessel travels over the lanes, they do so in hyperspeed.

# Creation

The starlanes are a creation of [[Extyx - Primordial Infinity|Extyx]]. However, as with many things primordial, it is unknown as to why.

## Temporary Lanes

# Travel

To travel on the starlanes, one needs a vessel clad in [[Aberant]]. This metal seems to ‘reject’ the lanes, gliding off it.^[Some dispute the idea that it’s ‘gliding’, and claim it’s closer to ‘high frequency bouncing’.] The resulting effect is hyperspeed traveling.^[traveling at speeds greater than the speed of light.] most [[Imperium]] vessels come with a map of the lanes built into their PDA. Note that even with a vessel it’s still possible to travel the lanes, but at regular speeds. It is advised to avoid such a scenario, as it turns travel of just a few hours into millions of years.

## Off-Lane

Because the starlanes are basically an highway between colonized worlds,  it sometimes becomes necessary to travel off-lane. Situations where it’s common to travel off-lane include:

- Resource gathering
- Battles
- Salvaging
- Research
- Stealth

Note that ships without an [[Aberant]] chasis can
