# Borrowing

```toc
```

## Abilities

Borrowing allows a user, from here on out called a [[Borrower]], to share their mind with another creature. A [[Borrower]] can feel the senses of said creature and interpret their thoughts. Through subtle suggestion a trained [[borrower]] can even slightly influence the creature’s actions.

It is possible to fully control another creature’s mind. This is a one time deal, however. Taking ownership of another’s mind requires that mind to be completely empty. This power crushes the soul of the creature, leaving them dead at the end of the borrow.

## Limits

- It is impossible to borrow more than one creature at a time, with the exception of swarm masters
- You can lose your mind when borrowing a mind whose thoughts are too complex for you to handle
- Borrowing leaves your mind vulnerable. While you are inside another creature’s mind, someone else can hide inside yours

Borrowing is not without its flaws. It is a type of magic where you leave your own mind behind. If you’re not in a secure place, someone else can take refugee in your head. Spying without you ever knowing.

Once someone inhabits another creature’s mind, they’re in dangerous territory. Another creature’s mind can be more complex than you might expect. Dogs, for example, are simple to control as they’re quite sensitive to suggestions from their owner. However, their constantly shifting thoughts, ideas, and attentions, can cause a borrower to lose their thoughts in the rush. It is possible to lose your sense of self without the proper amount of concentration. It is advice for an apprentice borrower to train with mice.

Lastly, it is not possible to control more than one creature at a time, with some exceptions. Some borrowers have learned to expand/splinter their minds to control more than one creature at a time. These multiple creatures need to be of a single species, and need to have a social hierarchy like a swarm, colony, or pack. They call themselves [[Swarm Lords]]^[Name subject to change].

# Reference

## Brainstorm Notes

- Perhaps “borrowing” us a good magic system for [[Propadanje Kingdom|Propadanje]]. Perhaps a connection like borrowing could cause some form of symbiotic connection between a person and an insect/swarm
- A swarm master is considered the highest rank of borrower
- It is less straining on a mind to borrow a creature whose level of thinking is closer to your own
- The more complex the mind, the easier it is to lose yourself
- Borrowing is a two way kinda magic. If you put your mind open to have your thoughts shared, both your mind can enter someone else, but another mind can enter yours
