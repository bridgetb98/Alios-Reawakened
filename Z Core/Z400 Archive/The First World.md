# The First World

Before there was anything, nothing and everything lived separately. 

The goddess [[Thera - Primordial Matter|Thera]] lived her life in her fields of green with her playmates. The Elves. Immortal beings who danced and lived and loved. But that was a love the goddess had never felt.

The god [[Void - Primordial Energy|Void]] was drifting in an endless abyss. Not being one, not truly gone. Their realm was them and they lived in it. Alone but not lonely, as they did not feel.

A lone elf one day bumped into the realm of void. It left a something in nothing.

The god had taken notice. They started to feel... intrigued. They were able to replicate this something and made themselves a vessel. A puppet through which they could think and see and wander into everything.

The goddess Thera, alarmed, sought out this something she did not create. She met eyes with this vessel. And the two gods, got infatuated.
However, it was not to be. The vessel was an unnaturaal thing. An unstable being that quickly decayed.

The god Void vowed, as their vessel crumbled to a fine dust, to create anything. A place where both everything and nothing could embrace.

Thera, her love taken from her, left her realm. But without her influence, her realm collapsed.
