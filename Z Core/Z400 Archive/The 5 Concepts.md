# The 5 Concepts

5 base concepts:
- Promises
- Believe
- Knowledge
- Memory
- Conviction

Everyone is connected through the spirit veil. Woven by the goddess Niara on instructions from the 4th Lord Phises. The fabric consists of 5 strings. What string is used for your embroidery determines your affinity with magic. The 5 affinities, the base concepts are:
- Knowledge / curiosity. Those who practice this concept know the fabric's pressure points. However, if the precision isn't there, they likely damage the veil.
- Believe. A strong magic that can, and has, turned men into Gods. Though it requires a strong mind and many followers to produce any results. And what will happen to the God if belief falters?
- Promise. See the Tale Foundry video on promises as a magic system
- Memory. Seen as the strongest concept. The magic provides powers of the First World, as if it was never lost. But things can easily be forgotten.
- Conviction. Those with strong determination can shake the world around them. They have to be steadfast. Doubt is a common affliction.
All magic systems in this world are based on one or more of these concepts combined. Like the forge master magic in the empire of giant beasts. Knowing where to add scales to a weapon is important for it to create flames. But equally important is the conviction of the blacksmith to keep the flame stable upon use
