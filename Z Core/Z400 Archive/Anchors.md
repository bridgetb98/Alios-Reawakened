# Anchors

# Anchors

To help stabilize the veil, to keep the threads nice and tight, each concept has an anchor point. These anchors symbolize the true essence of their concept and are nearly unbreakable

## Memory

The anchor of memory is quite simple: our own truths. The things we did as children, our first kiss, nearly bleeding out in the street after getting mugged. Those memories that will stay with us 'till the day that we die keeps the magic strong. Just remember to never forget.

## Written Word

When we study, where do we acquire the necessary material? What evidence have we kept from when the world was first created? How do we know what ancient civilizations have risen and fallen? It's books, stories and the writing that has kept all that knowledge alive. Especially books keep the magic strong. Let's just hope the next dynasty doesn't burn the history they do not like.
