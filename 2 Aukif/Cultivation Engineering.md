# Cultivation Engineering

```toc
```

There has been some tinkering when it comes to the utilization of [[Sol-Tubes]] within mechanical applications. [[Sol-Tubes]] are most commonly found in experimental weapons. 

An example of a sol-enhanced weapon is the growth gun. If the bullet does not kill a person, the enchanted bullet causes a growth within the target's body. Roots tend to prefer wetter environments, and thus expand into the bloodstream eventually bursting the heart.
