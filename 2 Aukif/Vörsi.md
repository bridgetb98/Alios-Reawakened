# Vörsi

```toc
```

- I am Vörsi, I am the uncertainty in one another's intentions, I am the absence of full knowledge, I am the Shadow beyond the treeline and the space you cannot see due to glare. It is not the void, nor is it the darkness within, it is the lack of knowledge that leads to distrust. You may find solace in probability and hope but certainty is lacking. Nothing is truth before it is seen, nothing has happened before it does. Is it not nice to not know everything? find peace in this uncertainty for it is not predetermined
- I used to be a middle-aged midwife named Lydia. childbirth is a wonderful thing for it is always full of surprises. I suppose my new form is a first, though it is hard to tell due to the nature of this affinity. there does seem to be a strong antithesis against the god of unlimited knowledge, perhaps it has something to do with it, possible, yet not certain
