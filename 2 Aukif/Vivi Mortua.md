# Vivi Mortua

```toc
```

- My name is Vivi Mortua. I am the god of fungus, decomposition and rebirth. I am prayed to by those that view themselves as being in the lowest possible point, and help them by showing them the rot in their lives in visions. Once they destroy the rot, they can begin to grow again.
- I was a child born under the worst possible circumstances^[TBD] and was bound to die at a young age. The strand of my fate was short. The god of sun and light saw that there was darkness that she could never reach or imagine, and picked the shortest strand she could find. She imbued it with light, and I ascended godhood, tasked with one thing: change the purest darkness to mere shadow so the light could touch it once more
