Hello! And welcome to the wiki of [[Alios]]; a literary universe created by [[Bridget A.M. Bleij]], and contributed to by many.

In here you’ll be able to find any and all things written^[Given many, *many*, exceptions.] about [[Alios]], [[Aukif]], [[The Embrace]], and the many mysteries and overall silliness that can be found. Here at the home page, I’ll give you some info how to traverse this wiki and how to properly create your own articles!

# Theme

This vault uses the [ITS Theme](https://publish.obsidian.md/slrvb-docs/ITS+Theme/ITS+Theme), which provides a *lot* of features. For one, it justifies text. I personally find justified text easier to read, so for me this is a welcome addition.

More importantly, it allows for special callouts. These callouts are:

> [!column|no-t]
> 
>> [!info|clean no-title]
>> - Asides
>> - Captions
>> - Cards
>> - Checks
>> - Colors
>> - Columns
>> - Grid
>
>> [!info|clean no-title]
>> - Infoboxes
>> - Kanban
>> - Kith
>> - Metadata
>> - Quote
>> - Statblocks
>> - Timeline

These are really useful to spice up articles. Eventually, these will have their own templates, but that’s still a work in progress.

# Plugins

*WIP*

# Navigation

If you’ve opened one of the folders, you’ll quickly see that all articles are dumped into that folder. This is chaotic, but intentional. If you want to search through the vault, the best way is through #index cards. These can be found in folder `Z000`. Through these index cards, you can find a multitude of subjects^[or #MOC]. These subjects help you navigate to the right articles.

## Card ID

Another method is using the ID of the different cards. All cards have a number designating their position in the vault. These numbers look as follows:

$$
Tag: ABCC.D
$$

- $A$: Primary category
- $B$: Sub category
- $CC$: ID
- $.D$: Position

For example, a card with ID $1602.1$^[[[Goblins|1602.1]]] is

- $1$ The Embrace
- $6$ Flora & Fauna
- $02$ Goblin
- $.1$ First card

Hopefully this clears some things up!
